## 📁 Place Your 3D Environment Here

### Files needed:
1. **scene.gltf** or **scene.glb** - Your main 3D environment model
2. **textures/** folder - Contains all texture files (.jpg, .png, etc.)

### Example file structure:
```
new-environment/
├── scene.gltf         ← Main 3D model file
├── textures/          ← Texture files folder
│   ├── ground.jpg
│   ├── wall.png
│   ├── sky.jpg
│   └── ...
└── README.md          ← This file
```

### How to add your environment:
1. Download a 3D environment from Sketchfab, Poly Haven, etc.
2. Extract the downloaded files
3. Copy the .gltf/.glb file here as 'scene.gltf'
4. Copy all texture files to the 'textures/' folder
5. Select "Custom 3D" in the game environment selector!

### Recommended environment types:
- Cyberpunk/futuristic cities
- Post-apocalyptic scenes
- Sci-fi corridors
- Fantasy landscapes
- Urban environments

### Performance tips:
- Keep models under 50MB
- Use .glb format for better compression
- Aim for under 50k polygons for smooth performance
